## Quick intro

My name is Avishek Neupane. I currently live in New York City. I'm originally from Kathmandu, Nepal. I spent 19 years of my life there before I came to the US for my undergraduate education at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. I majored in Computer Science and minored in Business.

After graduating in 2014, I moved to Seattle and started working at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. In 2019, I decided to leave Amazon and take a year off. I got married to Anustha in 2019 and moved from Seattle to New York City where Anustha lives. After a longer than expected job search process, I am joining Shopify as a Software Developer.
